# Instruction

## Read and understand the code, the logic behind it, the limitation of it
* Answer the question 1 - 4 below (you can edit this file directly)
* Change the code such that it will sort from larger to smaller, put the revision of your code below
* Change the code such that there is no flag variable, put the commit number below and answer question 5 


## Revision, put your commit number here
* Sort from larger to smaller:f4a4b2f6
* Without flag:f4a4b2f6

## Questions
1. How this code can sort number from smaller to larger
 
Answer: it use loop for check if number we select is smaller next number it will be swap and begin loop again

2. What if two numbers equal, what will happen?
